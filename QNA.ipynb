            "{'train': [{'id': 1, 'title': 'Python', 'context': 'To access an element in a Python iterable, such as a list, you need to use an index that corresponds to the position of the element.In Python, indexing is zero-based. This means the first element has 0 as its index, the second element has 1 as its index, and so on.In Python, it is also possible to use negative indexing to access values of a sequence.Negative indexing accesses items relative to the end of the sequence.

This means the first element has 0 as its index, the second element has 1 as its index, and so on.In Python, it is also possible to use negative indexing to access values of a sequence.Negative indexing accesses items relative to the end of the sequence. The index -1 reads the last element, -2 the second last, and so on.In Python, slicing makes it possible to access parts of sequences, such as strings or lists. This makes it possible to access, modify, and delete items in a readable and concise fashion.Slicing works similar to indexing, but instead of accessing a single value, multiple values are accessed.Slicing uses indexing to access the range of elements. These indexes are also zero-based.To reverse a list in Python, you can use negative slicing. As you want to slice the whole list, you can omit the start and stop values altogether.To reverse the slicing, specify a negative step value.As you want to include each value in the reversed list, the step size should be -1.[::-1] means you create a slice of a sequence that traverses the whole sequence starting from the end of it.Normally, the slicing follows sequence[start:stop:step] syntax. However, when you want to go from the beginning of the sequence to the end of it, you can omit start and stop.

Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python's benevolent dictator for life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution[56] and web cache poisoning.In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) will only receive security fixes going forward. On September 7, 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.As of November 2022, Python 3.11.0 is the current stable release and among the notable changes from 3.10 are that it is 10–60% faster and significantly improved error reporting.Python 3.12 (alpha 2) has improved error messages. \",\n",

This means the first element has 0 as its index, the second element has 1 as its index, and so on.In Python, it is also possible to use negative indexing to access values of a sequence.Negative indexing accesses items relative to the end of the sequence. The index -1 reads the last element, -2 the second last, and so on.In Python, slicing makes it possible to access parts of sequences, such as strings or lists. This makes it possible to access, modify, and delete items in a readable and concise fashion.Slicing works similar to indexing, but instead of accessing a single value, multiple values are accessed.Slicing uses indexing to access the range of elements. These indexes are also zero-based.To reverse a list in Python, you can use negative slicing. As you want to slice the whole list, you can omit the start and stop values altogether.To reverse the slicing, specify a negative step value.As you want to include each value in the reversed list, the step size should be -1.[::-1] means you create a slice of a sequence that traverses the whole sequence starting from the end of it.Normally, the slicing follows sequence[start:stop:step] syntax. However, when you want to go from the beginning of the sequence to the end of it, you can omit start and stop. To indicate you want to start slicing from the end and end at the start, specify a negative step.',\n",

        "\n",
        "  What is the Data Science process?\n",
        "  Obtaining the data\n",
        "  The first step is to identify what type of data needs to be analyzed, and this data needs to be exported to an excel or a CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Scrubbing the data\n",
        "  It is essential because before you can read the data, you must ensure it is in a perfectly readable state, without any mistakes, with no missing or wrong values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Exploratory Analysis\n",
        "  Analyzing the data is done by visualizing the data in various ways and identifying patterns to spot anything out of the ordinary. To analyze the data, you must have excellent attention to detail to identify if anything is out of place.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Modeling or Machine Learning\n",
        "  A data engineer or scientist writes down instructions for the Machine Learning algorithm to follow based on the Data that has to be analyzed. The algorithm iteratively uses these instructions to come up with the correct output.\n",

This means the first element has 0 as its index, the second element has 1 as its index, and so on.In Python, it is also possible to use negative indexing to access values of a sequence.Negative indexing accesses items relative to the end of the sequence. The index -1 reads the last element, -2 the second last, and so on.In Python, slicing makes it possible to access parts of sequences, such as strings or lists. This makes it possible to access, modify, and delete items in a readable and concise fashion.Slicing works similar to indexing, but instead of accessing a single value, multiple values are accessed.Slicing uses indexing to access the range of elements. These indexes are also zero-based.To reverse a list in Python, you can use negative slicing. As you want to slice the whole list, you can omit the start and stop values altogether.To reverse the slicing, specify a negative step value.As you want to include each value in the reversed list, the step size should be -1.[::-1] means you create a slice of a sequence that traverses the whole sequence starting from the end of it.Normally, the slicing follows sequence[start:stop:step] syntax.

Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his permanent vacation from his responsibilities as Python's benevolent dictator for life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features. Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to possible remote code execution[56] and web cache poisoning.In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security issues. When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) will only receive security fixes going forward. On September 7, 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.As of November 2022, Python 3.11.0 is the current stable release and among the notable changes from 3.10 are that it is 10–60% faster and significantly improved error reporting.Python 3.12 (alpha 2) has improved error messages. \",\n",
